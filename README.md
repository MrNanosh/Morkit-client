# Morkit - a social market place for regular people

## Summary of features

Morkit was designed to aid normal people in making
sales. Users can click a button to check the availability
or to ask to purchase an item another user has posted.
Managing Inventory is as simple as clicking and editing
a spreadsheet. Items that are brand new will show up on the
splash page and users can ask the owner if it is available
or just generally express their interest in the item.
Users can manage their messages at /messages where they can
respond to individual messages. Messages are not seen as
conversations since the app treats messages as individual
inquiries. Think of Messages as requests for buying and
checking availability only.
